                <h1 style="color: #d8413f;">Why Should You Visit Dubai</h1>
                <p>Dubai has evolved over the years to become one of the world's most prestigious and popular tourists attractions, enticing visitors from different sectors to its shores to experience what the 'must visit' destination has to offer.</p>
                <p>Although official figures have yet to be released, data from Statista predict that over 11.95 people travelled from across the globe to the emirate during 2014, up from 11.12 million in 2013 - demonstrating that the appeal of Dubai as a tourist destination has grown further.</p>
                <p>As a place famous for superlatives, such as the world's biggest skyscraper and largest mall, it's unsurprising that people flock to its shores to set their eyes on its great feats and achievements, but what keeps people coming back year after year?</p>
    
                <h1>Hotels</h1>
                <p>Dubai is home to some of the world's grandest and most luxurious hotels, offering guests five-star experiences during their stay.</p>
                <p>Tourists have a choice of staying in different areas of the emirate based on what it is they are after, which means a person could visit many times and still discover something new depending on where exactly they choose to lodge.</p>
                <p>You could pick a waterfront hotel and wake up every day to golden sands or stay in Ras Al Khaimah to surround yourself with a breathtaking backdrop of rugged mountains and an awe-inspiring coastline.</p>
                <p>Dubai's myriad of hotels are definitely one of the top reasons it is so popular with tourists, both new and returning.</p>
    
                <h1>Cosmopolitan lifestyle mixed with local culture</h1>
                <p>The emirate is able to offer visitors the perfect mix of a cosmopolitan city with traditional aspects of the local culture. There is a feeling of energy and high spirits no matter where you go in Dubai, whether that be to watch fantastic firework displays or visiting local markets.</p>
                <p>From traditional restaurants serving local dishes to a wealth of entertainment options, Dubai has something to offer everyone.</p>
                <p>In addition, the emirate's colourful and lively souks offer tourists a real taste of traditional Dubai and allow them the opportunity to try their hand at bartering to buy presents for themselves or gifts for those back home.</p>
    
                <h1>World-class shopping</h1>
                <p>As mentioned earlier, Dubai is home to the world's largest mall, so it would be remiss not to mention the emirate's shopping facilities, which are well-known across the globe. The malls are modern, air-conditioned and feature the latest fashions.</p>
                <p>Not only can you find your favorite and popular brands in the retail outlets located in the region, but you can also experience the gold markets, which offer platinum, diamonds and occasionally silver at cheaper prices than you can find in the UK.</p>
                
                <h1>There's plenty to do</h1>
                <p>Where else in the world can you be skiing on real snow one minute then riding sand dunes next? It would be impossible to try everything Dubai has to offer in a single trip, which is why people return over and over again.</p>
                <p>Visitors can marvel at the modern and beautiful Arabic architecture, discover the history and culture of the emirate, swim with dolphins, ride a camel in the desert, enjoy a day at the waterpark, embark on a hot air balloon adventure, plus much more.</p>
                <p>Tourists are spoilt for choice when they visit Dubai and they might have a list of things they want to do, but it could take several trips to complete.</p>
